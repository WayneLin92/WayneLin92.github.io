## About Me
I am currently an instructor in [School of Mathematical Science](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

My research interests includes stable homotopy theory and computational algebra for algebraic topology.

My PhD advisor is Prof. [J. Peter May](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/).

Here is my [CV](./assets/pdf/CV_Weinan_Lin.pdf).

Here is my [research statement](./assets/pdf/Research_Statement.pdf).
